## Metadata
issue_number: `18`
adw_id: `e607356d`
issue_json: `{"title": "Add Page Footer", "body": "Add a footer to the page with copyright information, useful links, and version info"}`

## Chore Description
Add a comprehensive footer component to the Natural Language SQL Interface application that includes copyright information, useful links, and version information. The footer should be consistently styled with the existing design system and be responsive across different screen sizes.

## Relevant Files
Use these files to resolve the chore:

- `app/client/index.html` - Main HTML file where the footer structure will be added
- `app/client/src/style.css` - CSS file for styling the footer component
- `app/client/src/main.ts` - Main TypeScript file for any footer interactivity (if needed)
- `README.md` - Project documentation to understand features and structure
- `app/client/package.json` - To get version information for display in footer

## Step by Step Tasks

### Retrieve Version Information
- Read `app/client/package.json` to get the application version
- Note the version number for display in the footer

### Add Footer HTML Structure
- Edit `app/client/index.html` to add a footer element after the main container
- Include three sections in the footer:
  - Left section: Copyright information with current year
  - Center section: Useful links (Documentation, GitHub, Support)
  - Right section: Version information and build status
- Ensure semantic HTML with proper ARIA attributes for accessibility

### Style the Footer Component
- Edit `app/client/src/style.css` to add footer styling
- Create CSS classes for:
  - Footer container with fixed positioning at bottom
  - Footer content sections (left, center, right)
  - Footer links with hover effects matching the existing theme
  - Responsive layout for mobile devices
- Use existing CSS custom properties for colors to maintain consistency
- Add proper spacing and typography matching the existing design

### Add Footer Interactivity
- Edit `app/client/src/main.ts` if needed to:
  - Dynamically update copyright year
  - Handle footer link clicks (if internal navigation needed)
  - Ensure footer doesn't overlap with main content

### Test Responsive Design
- Ensure footer displays correctly on different screen sizes
- Verify footer links are accessible and clickable
- Check that footer doesn't interfere with existing functionality

### Final Polish and Accessibility
- Add proper semantic HTML tags
- Ensure keyboard navigation works for footer links
- Add appropriate ARIA labels for screen readers
- Verify color contrast meets accessibility standards

### Run Validation Commands
- Execute validation commands to ensure no regressions

## Validation Commands
Execute every command to validate the chore is complete with zero regressions.

- `cd app/client && bun run build` - Build the client application to ensure no build errors
- `cd app/client && bun run dev` - Start the development server to visually verify the footer
- `cd app/server && uv run pytest` - Run server tests to validate the chore is complete with zero regressions

## Notes
- The footer should maintain the existing design language with the gradient colors (#667eea and #764ba2)
- Footer should be sticky/fixed at the bottom of the viewport
- Links in the footer should open in new tabs if they are external
- Consider adding social media icons if relevant
- The footer should not interfere with the modal overlay (z-index consideration)
- Version information could be dynamically pulled from package.json or environment variables
