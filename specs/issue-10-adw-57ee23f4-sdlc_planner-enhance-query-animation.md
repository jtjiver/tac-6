## Metadata
issue_number: `10`
adw_id: `57ee23f4`
issue_json: `{"body":"Can we be more creative and add more colour to the page in the query click animation. Use adw_plan to complete the planning","number":10,"title":"Update Query animation"}`

## Feature Description
Enhance the existing query button animation with more creative visual effects and vibrant colors. The current implementation uses canvas-confetti with a standard confetti burst. This feature will upgrade the animation to be more eye-catching, colorful, and celebratory by adding multiple animation sequences, richer color palettes, and more dynamic particle effects that spread across the page rather than just originating from the button.

## User Story
As a user
I want to see more creative and colorful animations when I click the query button
So that the interface feels more vibrant, exciting, and visually delightful with each query execution

## Problem Statement
The current query button animation (implemented in issue #8) provides basic confetti feedback, but it's relatively subtle with limited colors and a single burst pattern. Users would benefit from a more spectacular, page-wide animation that uses a broader color palette and multiple animation sequences to make each query feel like a celebration. The animation should be more creative and spread color throughout the page to enhance the overall user experience.

## Solution Statement
Enhance the existing `triggerQueryAnimation()` function in `app/client/src/main.ts` by implementing multiple confetti bursts with diverse patterns, a richer color palette including gradients and vibrant hues, and sequential animation stages. The solution will include:
1. Multiple confetti burst patterns (left, right, center, top-down)
2. Extended color palette with 10+ vibrant colors including gradients
3. Sequential animation timing for continuous visual interest
4. Larger particle spread across the entire viewport
5. Mix of confetti shapes and sizes for variety

2. Verify animation works seamlessly with existing debounce logic
3. Test animation on different screen sizes and viewports
4. Update E2E test to validate new animation patterns
5. Validate no regressions in existing functionality

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

### Step 1: Research canvas-confetti Advanced Features
- Review canvas-confetti documentation for advanced configuration options
- Identify parameters for multiple bursts, shapes, and patterns
- Research best practices for sequential animations
- Document available configuration options:
  - `origin` for positioning bursts
  - `angle` and `spread` for directional control
  - `particleCount` for density
  - `colors` array for custom palettes
  - `shapes` for particle variety
  - `gravity`, `decay`, `velocity` for physics
  - `ticks` for animation duration

### Step 2: Design Enhanced Color Palette
- Extend current 5-color palette to 12+ vibrant colors
- Include colors that complement app theme (primary: #667eea, secondary: #764ba2)
- Add gradient shades and complementary hues:
  - Purples: #667eea, #764ba2, #9f7aea, #b794f6, #e9d5ff
  - Blues: #3b82f6, #60a5fa, #93c5fd
  - Pinks: #ec4899, #f472b6, #fbbf24
  - Greens: #10b981, #34d399
  - Oranges: #f59e0b, #fbbf24
  - Reds: #ef4444, #f87171
- Ensure high contrast and visibility against app background

### Step 3: Design Multiple Burst Patterns
- **Pattern 1: Center Explosion** (button origin)
  - Large radial burst from button position
  - 100+ particles
  - 360-degree spread
  - High initial velocity

- **Pattern 2: Side Fireworks** (left and right)
  - Two bursts from left and right edges
  - 75 particles each
  - Angled spread (70-110 degrees)
  - Upward trajectory

- **Pattern 3: Top-Down Confetti Rain**
  - Multiple bursts from top of viewport
  - 50 particles per burst
  - Downward spread
  - Lower velocity for "falling" effect

- **Pattern 4: Corner Sparkles**
  - Four small bursts from corners
  - 30 particles each
  - Inward spread toward center
  - Faster decay for sparkle effect

### Step 4: Implement Enhanced Animation Function
- Open `app/client/src/main.ts`
- Locate `triggerQueryAnimation()` function (lines 82-103)
- Replace existing single burst with multi-stage animation:

```typescript
function triggerQueryAnimation() {
  // Extended color palette (12+ vibrant colors)
  const colors = [
    '#667eea', '#764ba2', '#9f7aea', '#b794f6', '#e9d5ff',
    '#3b82f6', '#60a5fa', '#93c5fd',
    '#ec4899', '#f472b6',
    '#10b981', '#34d399',
    '#f59e0b', '#fbbf24',
    '#ef4444', '#f87171'
  ];

  // Get button position for origin calculation
  const queryButton = document.getElementById('query-button') as HTMLButtonElement;
  const rect = queryButton.getBoundingClientRect();
  const originX = (rect.left + rect.width / 2) / window.innerWidth;
  const originY = (rect.top + rect.height / 2) / window.innerHeight;

  // Stage 1: Center Explosion (immediate)
  confetti({
    particleCount: 100,
    spread: 180,
    origin: { x: originX, y: originY },
    colors: colors,
    ticks: 250,
    gravity: 1.2,
    decay: 0.94,
    startVelocity: 40,
    scalar: 1.0
  });

  // Stage 2: Side Fireworks (150ms delay)
  setTimeout(() => {
    // Left side burst
    confetti({
      particleCount: 75,
      angle: 60,
      spread: 70,
      origin: { x: 0.1, y: 0.6 },
      colors: colors,
      ticks: 200,
      gravity: 1.0,
      decay: 0.92,
      startVelocity: 35,
      scalar: 0.9
    });

    // Right side burst
    confetti({
      particleCount: 75,
      angle: 120,
      spread: 70,
      origin: { x: 0.9, y: 0.6 },
      colors: colors,
      ticks: 200,
      gravity: 1.0,
      decay: 0.92,
      startVelocity: 35,
      scalar: 0.9
    });
  }, 150);

  // Stage 3: Top-Down Confetti Rain (300ms delay)
  setTimeout(() => {
    const positions = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8];
    positions.forEach((x, index) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        confetti({
          particleCount: 50,
          angle: 270,
          spread: 45,
          origin: { x: x, y: 0 },
          colors: colors,
          ticks: 300,
          gravity: 0.8,
          decay: 0.91,
          startVelocity: 25,
          scalar: 0.8
        });
      }, index * 50);
    });
  }, 300);

  // Stage 4: Corner Sparkles (500ms delay)
  setTimeout(() => {
    const corners = [
      { x: 0.05, y: 0.05, angle: 135 },
      { x: 0.95, y: 0.05, angle: 225 },
      { x: 0.05, y: 0.95, angle: 45 },
      { x: 0.95, y: 0.95, angle: 315 }
    ];

    corners.forEach((corner) => {
      confetti({
        particleCount: 30,
        angle: corner.angle,
        spread: 55,
        origin: { x: corner.x, y: corner.y },
        colors: colors,
        ticks: 150,
        gravity: 1.3,
        decay: 0.95,
        startVelocity: 30,
        scalar: 0.7
      });
    });
  }, 500);
}
```

### Step 5: Test Enhanced Animation Locally
- Start the development server: `./scripts/start.sh`
- Load sample data (users table)
- Enter a test query
- Click the query button
- Observe the enhanced multi-stage animation:
  - Verify center explosion fires immediately
  - Verify side fireworks appear after 150ms
  - Verify top-down rain starts after 300ms
  - Verify corner sparkles finish the sequence after 500ms
- Confirm all color palette colors are visible
- Verify animation is more dramatic and page-wide
- Ensure query execution is not blocked
- Test with rapid clicks to verify debouncing still works

### Step 6: Update E2E Test Documentation
- Read `.claude/commands/e2e/test_query_animation.md`
- Update test documentation to reflect enhanced animation:
  - Add verification steps for multiple burst patterns
  - Update expected animation duration (from ~1s to ~1.5s)
  - Add note about extended color palette
  - Update screenshot timing to capture different animation stages
- Update success criteria to include:
  - Multiple canvas elements or animations stages visible
  - Extended color palette is evident in screenshots
  - Animation sequence completes without blocking query

### Step 7: Validate with E2E Test
- Read `.claude/commands/test_e2e.md`
- Execute E2E test: `.claude/commands/e2e/test_query_animation.md`
- Verify test captures enhanced animation stages
- Review screenshots to confirm:
  - Multiple burst patterns are visible
  - Rich color palette is evident
  - Animation is more dramatic and page-wide
  - Query results still display correctly

### Step 8: Run All Validation Commands
- Execute all validation commands listed below
- Verify zero regressions in existing tests
- Ensure frontend build succeeds
- Confirm no TypeScript errors
- Validate animation performance is acceptable

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
While canvas-confetti is a third-party library, we should verify:
- The enhanced animation function is called on button click
- Animation doesn't break existing query functionality
- Multiple setTimeout calls don't conflict with debounce logic
- Query execution completes normally during animation

### E2E Tests
Update `.claude/commands/e2e/test_query_animation.md` to validate:
1. **Enhanced Animation Trigger Test**
   - Verify multiple confetti bursts appear in sequence
   - Capture screenshots at different animation stages (0ms, 200ms, 400ms, 600ms)
   - Verify extended color palette is visible
   - Verify animation is more dramatic and page-wide

2. **Animation Performance Test**
   - Verify animation doesn't block query execution
   - Verify debounce logic still works correctly
   - Verify rapid clicks don't cause performance issues
   - Verify animation completes within expected timeframe (~1.5s)

3. **Integration Test**
   - Verify animation works with keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl+Enter)
   - Verify animation works on different viewport sizes
   - Verify query results display correctly during animation

### Edge Cases
- Animation with empty query (should not fire)
- Animation with disabled button (should not fire)
- Animation during query in progress (debounce prevents)
- Multiple rapid clicks (debounce prevents animation spam)
- Small viewport/mobile screens (verify animation scales appropriately)
- Browser without canvas support (graceful degradation via canvas-confetti)

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Enhanced animation uses 12+ vibrant colors including gradients

- `cd app/server && uv run pytest` - Run server tests to validate the feature works with zero regressions
- `cd app/client && bun tsc --noEmit` - Run frontend type checking to validate the feature works with zero regressions
- `cd app/client && bun run build` - Run frontend build to validate the feature works with zero regressions

## Notes

### Enhanced Animation Design Rationale
The multi-stage animation creates a more dramatic and memorable user experience:
1. **Center Explosion**: Immediate feedback from button location
2. **Side Fireworks**: Expands the celebration to full viewport width
3. **Top-Down Rain**: Creates movement and flow across the page
4. **Corner Sparkles**: Completes the spectacle with finishing touches

This progression creates a sense of escalating celebration that's more engaging than a single burst.

### Color Palette Strategy
The extended 16-color palette includes:
- **App theme colors** (purples): Maintains brand consistency
- **Blues**: Adds cool tones for variety
- **Pinks**: Adds warmth and vibrancy
- **Greens**: Provides contrast and freshness
- **Oranges/Yellows**: Adds brightness and energy
- **Reds**: Adds excitement and intensity

This palette ensures the animation is visually rich and dynamic while still complementing the app's design.

### Performance Considerations
- Total animation duration: ~1.5 seconds
- Total particles: ~550 across all stages
- Sequential timing prevents particle overload
- canvas-confetti is highly optimized for performance
- Animation runs independently of query execution
- No blocking or performance issues expected

### Future Enhancements
Consider for future iterations:
- User preference to enable/disable or reduce animation intensity
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query for accessibility
- Different animation patterns based on query complexity
- Sound effects to complement visual effects
- Custom animations for special queries or achievements

### Comparison to Original Implementation
**Original (Issue #8)**:
- Single confetti burst
- 5 colors (purple gradient)
- 75 particles
- ~1 second duration
- Origin from button only

**Enhanced (Issue #10)**:
- 4 sequential animation stages
- 16 vibrant colors (extended palette)
- ~550 particles total
- ~1.5 seconds duration
- Page-wide coverage (button, sides, top, corners)

The enhancement is **7x more particles**, **3x more colors**, and **4x more burst patterns**, creating a dramatically more creative and colorful experience as requested.
